MuJoCo Integration
==================

:class:`~newton.solvers.SolverMuJoCo` translates a Newton :class:`~newton.Model`
into a `MuJoCo <https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco>`_ model and steps it
with `mujoco_warp <https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp>`_.
Because MuJoCo has its own modelling conventions, some Newton properties are
mapped differently or not at all.  The sections below describe each conversion
in detail.

Coordinate conventions
----------------------

**Quaternion order.**
  Newton stores quaternions as ``(x, y, z, w)``; MuJoCo uses ``(w, x, y, z)``.
  The solver converts between the two automatically.  Be aware of this when
  inspecting raw MuJoCo model or data objects (e.g. via ``save_to_mjcf`` or
  the ``mj_model``/``mj_data`` attributes on the solver).


Joint types
-----------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 35 40

   * - Newton type
     - MuJoCo type(s)
     - Notes
   * - ``FREE``
     - ``mjJNT_FREE``
     - Initial pose taken from ``body_q``.
   * - ``BALL``
     - ``mjJNT_BALL``
     - Per-axis actuators mapped via ``gear``.
   * - ``REVOLUTE``
     - ``mjJNT_HINGE``
     -
   * - ``PRISMATIC``
     - ``mjJNT_SLIDE``
     -
   * - ``D6``
     - Up to 3 × ``mjJNT_SLIDE`` + 3 × ``mjJNT_HINGE``
     - Each active linear/angular DOF becomes a separate MuJoCo joint
       (``_lin``/``_ang`` suffixes, with numeric indices when multiple axes
       are active).
   * - ``FIXED``
     - *(no joint)*
     - The child body is nested directly under its parent.  If the fixed joint
       connects to the world, the body is created as a **mocap** body.


Geometry types
--------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 50

   * - Newton type
     - MuJoCo type
     - Notes
   * - ``SPHERE``
     - ``mjGEOM_SPHERE``
     -
   * - ``CAPSULE``
     - ``mjGEOM_CAPSULE``
     -
   * - ``CYLINDER``
     - ``mjGEOM_CYLINDER``
     -
   * - ``BOX``
     - ``mjGEOM_BOX``
     -
   * - ``ELLIPSOID``
     - ``mjGEOM_ELLIPSOID``
     -
   * - ``PLANE``
     - ``mjGEOM_PLANE``
     - Must be attached to the world body.  Rendered size defaults to
       ``5 × 5 × 5``.
   * - ``HFIELD``
     - ``mjGEOM_HFIELD``
     - Heightfield data is normalized ``[0, 1]``; the geom origin is shifted
       by ``min_z`` so the lowest point is at the correct world height.
   * - ``MESH`` / ``CONVEX_MESH``
     - ``mjGEOM_MESH``
     - MuJoCo only supports **convex** collision meshes.  Non-convex meshes are
       convex-hulled automatically, which changes the collision boundary.
       ``maxhullvert`` is forwarded from the mesh source when set.

**Sites** (shapes with the ``SITE`` flag) are converted to MuJoCo sites, which
are non-colliding reference frames used for sensor attachment and spatial
tendons.


Shape parameters
----------------

**Friction.**
  Newton's ``shape_material_mu``, ``shape_material_mu_torsional``, and
  ``shape_material_mu_rolling`` map directly to MuJoCo's three-element
  geom ``friction`` vector: ``(sliding, torsional, rolling)``.

**Stiffness and damping (solref).**
  Newton's ``shape_material_ke`` (stiffness) and ``shape_material_kd``
  (damping) are converted to MuJoCo's geom ``solref`` ``(timeconst, dampratio)``
  pair.  When either value is zero or negative, the solver falls back to MuJoCo's defaults
  (``timeconst = 0.02``, ``dampratio = 1.0``).

**Joint-limit stiffness and damping (solref_limit).**
  ``joint_limit_ke`` and ``joint_limit_kd`` are forwarded as negative
  ``solref_limit`` values ``(-ke, -kd)``, which MuJoCo interprets as direct
  stiffness/damping rather than time-constant/damp-ratio.

**Margin.**
  Newton's ``shape_margin`` maps to MuJoCo ``geom_margin``.

**MuJoCo-specific custom attributes.**
  Many MuJoCo-specific parameters are stored in Newton's ``mujoco``
  custom-attribute namespace and forwarded to the MuJoCo model when present.
  These cover geom properties (``condim``, ``geom_priority``, ``geom_solimp``,
  ``geom_solmix``), joint properties (``dof_passive_stiffness``,
  ``dof_passive_damping``, ``jnt_actgravcomp``, ``dof_springref``, ``dof_ref``,
  ``limit_margin``, ``solimplimit``, ``solreffriction``, ``solimpfriction``),
  equality constraints (``eq_solref``), tendons, general actuators, and solver
  options.  See :doc:`/concepts/custom_attributes` for the full list.


Collision filtering
-------------------

Newton uses integer ``shape_collision_group`` labels to control which shapes
can collide.  MuJoCo uses ``contype``/``conaffinity`` bitmasks with a different
semantic: two geoms collide when
``(contype_A & conaffinity_B) || (contype_B & conaffinity_A)`` is non-zero.

The solver bridges the two systems with **graph coloring**.  Shapes that must
*not* collide are assigned the same color; each color maps to one bit in
``contype``.  ``conaffinity`` is set to the complement so that same-color
geoms never match.  Up to 32 colors are supported (one per ``contype`` bit).
If the graph requires more than 32 colors, shapes with color index ≥ 32 fall
back to MuJoCo defaults (``contype=1``, ``conaffinity=1``) and will collide
with all other shapes, silently bypassing the intended filtering.

Non-colliding shapes (no ``COLLIDE_SHAPES`` flag, or ``collision_group == 0``)
get ``contype = conaffinity = 0``.

Additionally, body pairs for which all shape-shape combinations are filtered
are registered as ``<exclude>`` elements.


Mass and inertia
----------------

Bodies with positive mass have their mass, center-of-mass offset (``ipos``),
and inertia tensor set explicitly (``explicitinertial="true"``).  When the
inertia tensor is diagonal the solver uses ``diaginertia``; otherwise it uses
``fullinertia``.

Zero-mass bodies (e.g. sensor frames) omit mass and inertia entirely, letting
MuJoCo derive them from child geoms (``inertiafromgeom="auto"``).


Actuators
---------

Newton's per-DOF ``joint_target_mode`` determines which MuJoCo general
actuators are created:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Mode
     - MuJoCo actuator(s)
   * - ``POSITION``
     - One actuator: ``gainprm = [kp]``, ``biasprm = [0, -kp, -kd]``.
   * - ``VELOCITY``
     - One actuator: ``gainprm = [kd]``, ``biasprm = [0, 0, -kd]``.
   * - ``POSITION_VELOCITY``
     - Two actuators — a position actuator (``gainprm = [kp]``,
       ``biasprm = [0, -kp, 0]``) and a velocity actuator
       (``gainprm = [kd]``, ``biasprm = [0, 0, -kd]``).
   * - ``NONE``
     - No actuator created for this DOF.

``joint_effort_limit`` is forwarded as ``actfrcrange`` on the joint (for
prismatic, revolute, and D6 joints) or as ``forcerange`` on the actuator (for
ball joints).

Additional MuJoCo general actuators (motors, etc.) can be attached through
custom attributes and are appended after the joint-target actuators.


Equality constraints

   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Newton type
     - MuJoCo type
     - Notes
   * - ``CONNECT``
     - ``mjEQ_CONNECT``
     - Anchor forwarded in ``data[0:3]``.

     - ``coef0`` / ``coef1`` mapped to polynomial coefficients.
       Only ``REVOLUTE`` and ``PRISMATIC`` joints are supported.

``eq_solref`` custom attributes are forwarded when present.


Solver options
--------------

Solver parameters follow a three-level resolution priority:

1. **Constructor argument** — value passed to :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverMuJoCo`.
2. **Custom attribute** (``model.mujoco.<option>``) — supports per-world values.
   These attributes are typically populated automatically when importing USD or
   MJCF assets.
3. **Default** — the table below lists Newton defaults alongside MuJoCo
   defaults for reference.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 25 25

   * - Option

   * - ``integrator``
     - ``implicitfast``
     - ``euler``
     - ``implicitfast`` provides better stability for stiff systems.

Multi-world support
-------------------

When ``separate_worlds=True`` (the default for GPU mode with multiple worlds),
the solver builds a
MuJoCo model from the **first world** only and replicates it across all worlds
via ``mujoco_warp``.  This requires all Newton worlds to be structurally
identical (same bodies, joints, and shapes).  Global entities (those with a
negative world index) may only include static shapes — they are shared across
all worlds without replication.


Collision pipeline
------------------

By default :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverMuJoCo` uses MuJoCo's built-in
collision detection (``use_mujoco_contacts=True``).  Alternatively, you can set
``use_mujoco_contacts=False`` and pass contacts computed by Newton's own
collision pipeline into :meth:`~newton.solvers.SolverMuJoCo.step`.  Newton's
pipeline supports non-convex meshes, SDF-based contacts, and hydroelastic
contacts, which are not available through MuJoCo's collision detection.


Caveats
-------

**geom_gap is always zero.**
  MuJoCo's ``gap`` parameter controls *inactive* contact generation — contacts
  that are detected but do not produce constraint forces until penetration
  exceeds the gap threshold.  Newton does not use this concept: when the MuJoCo
  collision pipeline is active it runs every step, so there is no benefit to
  keeping inactive contacts around.  Setting ``geom_gap > 0`` would inflate
  ``geom_margin``, which disables MuJoCo's multicontact and degrades contact
  quality.  Therefore :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverMuJoCo` always sets
  ``geom_gap = 0`` regardless of the Newton :attr:`~newton.ModelBuilder.ShapeConfig.gap`
  value.  MJCF/USD ``gap`` values are still imported into
  :attr:`~newton.ModelBuilder.ShapeConfig.gap` in the Newton model, but they are
  not forwarded to the MuJoCo solver.

**shape_collision_radius is ignored.**
  MuJoCo computes bounding-sphere radii (``geom_rbound``) internally from the
  geometry definition.  Newton's ``shape_collision_radius`` is not forwarded.

**Non-convex meshes are convex-hulled.**
  MuJoCo only supports convex collision geometry.  If a Newton ``MESH`` shape
  is non-convex, MuJoCo will automatically compute its convex hull, changing
  the effective collision boundary.

**Velocity limits are not forwarded.**
  Newton's ``joint_velocity_limit`` has no MuJoCo equivalent and is ignored.

**Body ordering must be depth-first.**
  The solver sorts joints in depth-first topological order for MuJoCo's
  kinematic tree.  If the Newton model's joint order differs, a warning is
  emitted because kinematics may diverge.


.. _mujoco-kinematic-links-and-fixed-roots:

Kinematic Links and Fixed Roots
-------------------------------

Newton only allows ``is_kinematic=True`` on articulation roots, so in the
MuJoCo exporter a "kinematic link" always means a kinematic root body. Any
descendants of that root can still be dynamic and are exported normally.

At runtime, :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverMuJoCo` keeps kinematic roots
user-prescribed rather than dynamically integrated:

- When converting MuJoCo state back to Newton, the previous Newton
  :attr:`newton.State.joint_q` and :attr:`newton.State.joint_qd` values are
  passed through for kinematic roots instead of being overwritten from MuJoCo's
  integrated ``qpos`` and ``qvel``.
- Applied body wrenches and joint forces targeting kinematic bodies are ignored
  on the MuJoCo side.
- Kinematic bodies still participate in contacts, so they can act as moving or
  fixed obstacles for dynamic bodies.

During export, :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverMuJoCo` maps roots according to
their joint type:

- **Kinematic roots with non-fixed joints** are exported as ordinary MuJoCo
  joints with the same Newton joint type and DOFs. The solver assigns a very
  large internal armature to those DOFs so MuJoCo treats them like prescribed,
  effectively infinite-mass coordinates.
- **Roots attached to world with a fixed joint** are exported as MuJoCo mocap
  bodies. This applies to both kinematic and non-kinematic Newton roots
  attached to world by :class:`~newton.JointType.FIXED`. MuJoCo has no joint
  coordinates for a fixed root, so Newton drives the pose through
  ``mjData.mocap_pos`` and ``mjData.mocap_quat`` instead.
- **World-attached shapes that are not part of an articulation** remain
  ordinary static MuJoCo geometry rather than mocap bodies.

If you edit :attr:`newton.Model.joint_X_p` or :attr:`newton.Model.joint_X_c`
for a fixed-root articulation after constructing the solver, call
``solver.notify_model_changed(newton.solvers.SolverNotifyFlags.JOINT_PROPERTIES)``
to synchronize the updated fixed-root poses into MuJoCo.
