"""Solver/coupling strategy interface.

A strategy owns everything that differs between coupling approaches: how the
robot's actuators are tuned, which collisions are filtered, the contact
materials, how the solver is built, the per-substep hook, and how
solver-internal state is reset. This is the axis swept by ``--solver``.
